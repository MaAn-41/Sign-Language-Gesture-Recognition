# Sign Language Gesture Recognition

Sign Language Gesture Recognition is an advanced machine learning-based system that enables the recognition and interpretation of sign language gestures in real-time. This project aims to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by leveraging deep learning models for accurate gesture classification.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Uses computer vision and deep learning to detect and classify sign language gestures.
- **Pre-Trained Model Integration**: Implements a trained neural network for efficient and accurate recognition.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for ease of use by both hearing-impaired users and researchers.
- **Customizable Dataset**: Allows integration of additional gestures for improved accuracy and adaptability.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Can be deployed on various devices, including PCs and mobile applications.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.8+
